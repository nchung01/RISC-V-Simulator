# RISC-V-Simulator

This repository contains a basic RISC-V instruction set simulator written in Python. It supports a core subset of instructions and allows step-by-step execution of RISC-V assembly programs for educational and performance analysis purposes.

📌 Features
✅ Supports core RISC-V instructions:
ADD, SUB, LW, SW, BEQ, JAL

🧠 Functional register file with proper updates

💾 Simulated memory model for load/store

📄 Reads and executes RISC-V programs from text files

📊 Outputs instruction and cycle counts

🔁 Control flow support via branching and jumps

*Disclaimer: Instructions BEQ and JAL do not work yet.
